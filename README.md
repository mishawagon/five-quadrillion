Five Quadrillion: A Model of the Value of the Earth by Caitlin & Misha is an emotional, knee-jerk reaction to a model of Earthâ€™s value. An astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz recently created an equation that calculates the value of planets in our solar system. The value of Earth comes out to be five quadrillion dollars. This interactive experience was created as an emotional interpretation of reductivist evaluations of our one-of-a-kind, priceless habitat.
